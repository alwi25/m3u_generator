# m3u_generator
Generates m3u files based on json defined information.

Use pyenv and pipenv to set correct python version and dependencies.

Adjust your json file according to your needs. Note that the m3u file is saved in the defined root folder and 
that all file references in the playlist file are relative to the root folder. This should allow for easy copy/pasting of
playlists to other media.
